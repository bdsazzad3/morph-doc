Season 2: The Great Token Migration is live. Earn Morph Points by bridging assets and spending gas through this season’s Bridging Program.

The bridging program is an initiative designed to incentivize users and communities to help build early liquidity and increase network activity on Morph. Participants can earn Morph Points through two main activities: bridging assets to the Morph Mainnet and using gas on the network. Additionally, users who invite others to join Season 2 and join the bonus event with other platforms will also receive extra rewards. This program aims to boost Morph's ecosystem while offering valuable incentives to active community members.

Here are the rules of Season 2 you need to know:


### Bridging Rules:

1. For Season 2, participants earn points when using the **canonical bridge**, **Orbiter Finance** and **Owlto Finance**. Currently, no other bridging methods or platforms are eligible for points.

- The **canonical bridge** can be accessed on the main page's right side.
- **Orbiter Finance** and **Owlto Finance** can be accessed by clicking the banner on the left.

2.  The assets you can bridge in Season 2 include:
- ETH, wETH, USDC, and USDT on the official bridge.
- ETH on Orbiter Finance and Owlto Finance.
- ETH directly withdraws from the crypto exchange to Morph.


The point formula will only *calculate for the tokens listed above.* 

Point Formula:

Point_Bridge = $\sum\left(\text {Asset}_{\text {eth}} * \text {Time}\right)$

For Bitget Wallet users:

Users with a Bitget Wallet address will have their points multiplied by a coefficient of 1.2.

Point_Bridge = $\sum\left(\text {Asset}_{\text {eth}} * \text {Time}\right)$ * 1.2


- 1 point = 1 ETH * 1 day. 1 point is equal to 1 ETH per day.
- The point is determined by the token amount and the duration it has been held on Morph Mainnet.
- For assets to be valid and eligible for calculation, these must be transferred through the bridge. If - assets are transferred between addresses and not via the bridge, they will not be counted for any calculations. For example, address A bridges 2 ETH from Ethereum to Morph Mainnet and then transfers 1ETH to address B on Morph Mainnet. The 1ETH sent to address B is invalid as it did not directly pass through the bridge and into the final wallet.
- The value of assets is determined by the price of ETH, obtained through the CoinMarketCap API.
- For instance, bridging 1000 USDT would be calculated as 0.41666667 ETH based on a CMC ETH price of $2400 for that moment.


The minimum holding time is one day. If you hold assets on the Morph Mainnet for less than a day, it is counted as 0.

For example, if a user bridges 3 ETH and 4800 USDT with holding times of 2 days and 2.5 days respectively, while the price of ETH is around $2400, the point would be calculated as such:


Point = $(3*2) + (2*2) = 10$


#### Tips:

- When assets are removed from the Morph Mainnet, the time counted stops.
- Our system will track the amount of assets in your address. If you transfer your assets to another address, the point will be updated based on your new balance.


### Gas Spending Rules:

1. Every transaction on Morph Mainnet has gas fees. This gas usage serves as your contribution towards developing and sustaining the Morph ecosystem. Spending gas allows you to earn rewards (points).
2. Users can earn points through the gas consumed on the Morph Mainnet. The calculation will count the total fee including L1 and L2 fees.
3. The greater the amount of gas used by an address, the higher its point it earns.


Point formula:

Point = 10000*Gas

For example, if a user spent 0.0001 ETH in gas on Morph Mainnet, the point would be:

Point = 10000*0.0001 = 1

### Invitation Rules:

1. Please copy and use your referral code or link and pass it along to your friends. Once they enter the referral code or click on your referral link to sign in, the process is complete. Only keep in mind that your friend is the one who connected the wallet and completed the sign-in for Season 2, which will count as a successful invite.
2. In Season 2, the referral system considers two levels of invitations:
- First-level invitations: You receive 10% of the invitee's point
- Second-level invitations: You receive 5% of the invitee's point
3. An invitee must connect their wallet on the Season 2 page and log in for the first time to confirm the referral. Without logging in, the invitation will not be deemed valid.



point formula:

*Point = $10 \%^{*}\left(\text {Point}_{A 1}+\text {Point}_{A 2}\right)+5 \%\left(\text {Point}_{B 1}+\text {Point}_{B 2}\right)$*

- Point *A1* is the bridging point of the first-level invitee, and point A2 represents the gas usage point of the first-level invitee.

- Point *B1* is the bridging point of the second-level invitee, and point B2 represents the gas usage point of the second-level invitee.

### Points Rules:

1. There are four primary ways to earn points: 
- Bridging assets to the Morph Mainnet, 
- Spending gas on the Morph Mainnet, 
- Inviting new users to Season 2 through your referral link, 
- Participating in special events like the “Bitget Wallet Event”.

2. You'll accumulate points throughout the season from bridging assets, spending gas, and inviting others. Once Season 2 ends, you can claim on the Morph Zoo page.

*Your points = $(a*{point}\_{Bridge}) + (b*{point}\_{Gas}) + {point}\_{Ref} + {Bonus}\_{event}$*

- *a* and *b* are coefficients optimized throughout the campaign to promote sustainable ecosystem growth.
- *point_Bridge* is your point from bridging assets to the Morph Mainnet.
- *point_Gas* is your point for spending gas on the Morph mainnet.
- *point_Ref* is your point for inviting new users to join Season 2 via your referral link.
- *Bonus_event* is an extra bonus for participating in special events, such as the Bitget Wallet collaboration.
