Season 2: The Great Token Migration is live, offering participants the chance to earn from a pool of 1,600,000 Morph Points until February 20, 2025.

This season is designed to build early liquidity and increase network activity on Morph. Participants can earn Morph Points through three key activities and a special selection of bonus activities: 
1. Bridging assets to the Morph Mainnet;
2. Spending gas on any on-chain activity; 
3. And inviting friends to join Season 2 
- Additional bonus rewards are available through special events hosted with partner platforms

Your participation is critical to Morph’s success, that’s why we’ve allocated 10% of Morph’s upcoming token launch specifically for community and ecosystem growth activities like the Morph Zoo. Every Morph Point you earn through Season 2 gets you a bigger share of the distribution while helping build a stronger Morph Ecosystem. 

Below are the Key Rules for Season 2:


### Bridging Rules:

1. For Season 2, participants earn points when using the **canonical bridge**, **Orbiter Finance** and **Owlto Finance**. Currently, no other bridging methods or platforms are eligible for points.

- The **canonical bridge** can be accessed on the main page's right side.
- **Orbiter Finance** and **Owlto Finance** can be accessed by clicking the banner on the left.

2.  The assets you can bridge in Season 2 include:
- ETH, wETH, USDC, and USDT on the official bridge.
- ETH on Orbiter Finance and Owlto Finance.
- ETH directly withdraws from the crypto exchange to Morph.


The point formula will only *calculate for the tokens listed above.* 


1. Season 2 participants earn points when bridging funds using the official Morph Bridge, Orbiter Finance, and Owlto Finance. Withdrawing ETH directly onto the Morph network from a supporting centralized exchange is also valid. Currently, no other bridging methods or platforms are eligible for points.
- Access Morph’s official bridge [here](https://www.morphl2.io/points/greattoken_migration/bridge) or find it on the left-side navigation menu on Season 2’s [homepage](https://www.morphl2.io/points/greattoken_migration/). 
- Orbiter Finance and Owlto Finance can also be accessed through [the bridge page](https://www.morphl2.io/points/greattoken_migration/bridge).
2. Assets that can bridged and counted for Morph Points in Season 2 include:
- ETH, wETH, USDC, and USDT on the official bridge.
- ETH on Orbiter Finance and Owlto Finance.
- ETH when directly withdrawn from a supporting crypto exchange onto Morph network.
Below is the formula for how we calculate your Morph Point earnings. Remember, *only the tokens listed above are eligible for points.*


**Point Calculation Formula:**

Point_Bridge = $\sum\left(\text {Asset}_{\text {eth}} * \text {Time}\right)$

**For Bitget Wallet users:**

Users using a Bitget Wallet address receive a special bonus, with points multiplied by a coefficient of 1.2.


Point_Bridge = $\sum\left(\text {Asset}_{\text {eth}} * \text {Time}\right)$ * 1.2


- 1 point = 1 ETH * 1 day. You get 1 Morph Point for every 1 ETH that you hold for a full day.
- The point is determined by the token amount and the duration it has been held on Morph Mainnet.
- For assets to be eligible for calculation, these must be transferred through one of the valid methods listed above. If assets are transferred between addresses and not via the bridge, they will not be counted for calculation. For example, **Address A** bridges 2 ETH from Ethereum to Morph Mainnet and then transfers 1 ETH to **Address B** on Morph Mainnet. The 1 ETH sent to **Address B** is invalid as it did not directly pass through the bridge and into the final wallet.
- The value of other tokens is determined by the price of ETH, obtained through the CoinMarketCap API.
- For example, bridging 1000 USDT would be calculated as 0.41666667 ETH based on a CMC ETH price of $2400 at that moment.
- The minimum holding time is one day. If you hold assets on the Morph Mainnet for less than a day, they will not earn you any points.
- For example, say a user bridges 3 ETH and 4800 USDT, holding the ETH for 2 days and the USDT for 2.5 days. If the price of ETH is $2400, the USDT can be counted as holding 2 ETH for 2 days, as the half day will not count.

Point = $(3*2) + (2*2) = 10$

2 ETH held for 2 days, and 2 ETH worth of USDT held for 2 valid days  


#### Tips:

- When assets are removed from the Morph Mainnet, the time counting immediately stops.
- Our system will track the amount of valid assets in your address. If you transfer your assets to another address, point calculations will be updated based on your new balance.



### Gas Spending Rules:

1. Every transaction on Morph Mainnet has gas fees. This gas usage serves as your contribution towards developing and sustaining the Morph ecosystem. 
2. Users can earn Morph Points for all activities that consume gas on the Morph Mainnet. Our calculations will count your total gas fees, including L1 and L2 fees.
3. The more gas you use, the more points you earn.

**Point Calculation formula:**

Point = 10000*Gas

For example, if a user spent 0.0001 ETH in gas fees on Morph Mainnet, the points earned would be:


10000*0.0001 = 1 Morph Point

### Referral/Invitation Rules:​

1. Season 2 participants earn points by referring new users to join our ecosystem. Each participant receives a unique referral code and link that can be shared with others. For a referral to be valid, the new user must:
- Connect their wallet to the Season 2 page
- Complete their first log in using your referral code or link
2. In Season 2, the referral system rewards two levels of participation:
- First-level referrals/invitations: You earn 10% of your direct invitee’s points
- Second-level referrals/invitations: You earn 5% of the points earned by those who joined through your direct invitees.

**Point Calculation Formula:**

*Point = $10 \%^{*}\left(\text {Point}_{A 1}+\text {Point}_{A 2}\right)+5 \%\left(\text {Point}_{B 1}+\text {Point}_{B 2}\right)$*

- A1 is the bridging points earned by your first-level invitees
- A2 represents the gas points earned by your first-level invitees.
- B1 is the bridging point earned by your second-level invitees
- B2 represents the gas points earned by your second-level invitees.


### Additional Morph Points Rules and Notes:​

1. There are three primary activities to earn points plus a set of special bonus activities:
- Bridging assets to Morph Mainnet,
- Spending gas on Morph Mainnet,
- Inviting new users to Season 2 through your referral link,
- Participating in special events like the “Bitget Wallet Event”.


2. You'll accumulate points throughout the season from all the activities described above. Once Season 2 ends, you can claim these on the Morph Zoo page.

*Your Total points = $(a*{point}\_{Bridge}) + (b*{point}\_{Gas}) + {point}\_{Ref} + {Bonus}\_{event}$*

- *a* and *b* are coefficients optimized throughout the campaign to promote sustainable ecosystem growth.
- *point_Bridge* are points earned from bridging assets to the Morph Mainnet.
- *point_Gas* are points earned by spending gas on the Morph mainnet.
- *point_Ref* are points earned by inviting new users to join Season 2 via your referral link.
