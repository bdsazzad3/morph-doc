## Faucet

### Sepolia ETH Faucet

To use Morph's public testnet, obtain testnet ETH on Sepolia, then bridge it to the Morph testnet.

Here are a few Sepolia faucet apps:

Once you receive ETH on Sepolia, you should see it in your wallet on the Sepolia Network. 

It may take a few seconds for them to appear, but you can check the status by looking for a transaction to your address on the [Sepolia Block Explorer](https://sepolia.etherscan.io/).
